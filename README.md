**Key Features & Technical Details:**
*   **Recursive File System Traversal:** Automatically scans through complex and deeply nested directory structures to locate all PDF files, regardless of their location.
*   **Batch PDF to TXT Conversion:** Efficiently converts multiple PDF documents into their corresponding plain text files.
*   **Preserves Directory Structure:** Recreates the exact original folder hierarchy for the converted `.txt` files, ensuring intuitive organization and easy retrieval.
*   **Simple Python Utility:** A straightforward, single-script solution for automating common document processing tasks and making PDF content accessible.

This utility demonstrates strong command of **Python scripting for automation**, **file system manipulation**, and **practical data transformation**.

### Instructions:
Place pdf files not matter if they are inside a folder inside a folder and a lot of folder with them, when running the .py file, will be mirrored the same folder structure but every pdf file would be converted to txt file.

Note: Reference section and Aknowledgement section will be deleted cause this work was implemented to convert pdf papers to txt.
